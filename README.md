# Protocol-Design
A design for a project for ICS2OI (Grade 10 Computer Science).
## Legend
- Side 1: The side that's communicating the data.
- Side 2: The side that's interpreting the data
## Setup
- Side 1 gets an orange flag, black flag, white flag and the 10x10 image.
- Side 2 gets a red and green flag as well as a 10x10 grid to fill in the pixels.
## Rules
Side 1 raises the orange flag to start. Side 1 then uses flags to say how many pixels in a row are filled or not filled.
